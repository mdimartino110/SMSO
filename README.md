parsingExcelExpanded.exe is a script created to allow easy organizing and formatting of data for Saint Mary's Highschool. The data is pulled  directly from myschoolapp, and can be inputted into the script after converting the CSV file that MSA spits out into a regular excel file. Currently, this program has two sorting functions. The first is demographic information. The second is for regents answer sheet formatting. For the demographic information, you will also need a District Code spreadsheet. This file can be updated with more district codes and zip codes as needed, and is included in the Saint Mary's Google Drive.

HOW TO USE FOR DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION:

1. Download the CSV of student data from myschoolapp lists. The list that gives a proper export is named "Student Info for Demographic Upload".
2. Open this CSV in Microsoft Excel. Click "Save As" and save the spreadsheet as a Microsoft Excel file, WITHOUT MAKING ANY CHANGES.
3. Run the parsingExcelExpanded.exe file. If Windows attempts to block the run, hit "More Info" and "Run Anyway". 
4. You will get a UI screen. Enter "1" into the text bar and click the button.
	a. The first window is where you will input your STUDENT INFORMATION SHEET.
	b. The second window is where you will input your DISTRICT CODE SHEET.
	c. The third window is where you want your ORGANIZED spreadsheet to be put.

HOW TO USE FOR REGENTS ANSWER SHEETS

1. Download the CSV of student data from myschoolapp lists. The list that gives a proper export is named "RIC Answer Sheets for Script".
2. Open this CSV in Microsoft Excel. Click "Save As" and save the spreadsheet as a Microsoft Excel file, WITHOUT MAKING ANY CHANGES.
3. Run the parsingExcelExpanded.exe file. If Windows attempts to block the run, hit "More Info" and "Run Anyway". 
4. You will get a UI screen. Enter "2" into the text bar and click the button.
	a. The first window is where you will input your STUDENT REGENTS INFORMATION SHEET.
	b. The second window is where you want your ORGANIZED spreadsheet to be put.

For both of these processes, the file explorer windows will have directions in the title if you forget.

ALWAYS check the organized spreadsheet before sending them to New York State in order to avoid errors.
